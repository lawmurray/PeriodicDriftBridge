LibBi package: PeriodicDriftBridge
==================================

Synopsis
--------

    ./init.sh

This simulates a number of data sets for testing and fits the bridge weight
function. GNU Octave is required. Running it is optional, as a number of
simulated data sets are already included.

    ./run.sh
    
This runs a particle filter as well as samples from the posterior distribution
for a fixed data set of four observations given in Lin, Chen & Mykland (2010).

    ./test.sh

This runs tests on the bootstrap and bridge particle filters on the simulated
data sets. Alternatively, these tests may be run as an array job on a cluster:

    qsub -t 0-15 qsub_test_bridge.sh
    qsub -t 0-15 qsub_test_bootstrap.sh
    qsub -t 0-15 qsub_test_exact.sh

The last line computes normalising constants to be used as "exact" values
when computing the MSE metric for comparison plots.

Finally, results may be plot with:

    octave --path oct/ --eval "plot_and_print"

GNU Octave and OctBi are required.
    
Note that, as of version 1.1.0 of LibBi, running any of these gives the
warnings:

    Warning (line 29): 'obs' variables should not appear on the right side of actions in the 'transition' block.
    Warning (line 42): 'obs' variables should not appear on the right side of actions in the 'lookahead_transition' block.

This is normal.


Description
-----------

This package implements the periodic drift diffusion process introduced in
Beskos et al. (2006) and further studied in Lin, Chen & Mykland (2010). The
form of the process model is the Ito stochastic differential
equation$$dx=\sin(x-\pi)\, dt+dW.$$ The task is to simulate diffusion bridges
between the observed values. It was used as a test case in Del Moral & Murray
(2014). The package may be used to reproduce the results in that paper.
